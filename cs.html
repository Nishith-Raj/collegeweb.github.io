        <p>Computer science and engineering (CSE) is an academic program at many universities which comprises 
            scientific and engineering aspects of computing. CSE is also a term often used in Europe to 
            translate the name of engineering informatics academic programs. It is offered in both undergraduate
             as well postgraduate with specializations.</p>

        <p>Academic programs vary between colleges, but typically include a combination of topics in computer 
            science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering. Undergraduate courses usually include 
            programming, algorithms and data structures, computer architecture, operating systems, computer 
            networks, parallel computing, embedded systems, algorithms design, circuit analysis and electronics, 
            digital logic and processor design, computer graphics, scientific computing, software engineering,
             database systems, digital signal processing, virtualization, computer simulations and games programming.
